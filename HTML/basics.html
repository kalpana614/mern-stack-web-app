        In 2010, GitHub was hosting 1 million repositories.[23] A year later, this number doubled.[24] ReadWriteWeb
         reported that GitHub had surpassed SourceForge and Google Code in total number of commits for the period of 
         January to May 2011.[25] On &lt;p&gt; January 16, 2013, GitHub passed the 3 million users mark and was then hosting more 
         than 5 million repositories.[26] By the end of the year, the number of repositories was twice as great, reaching 
         10 million repositories.
